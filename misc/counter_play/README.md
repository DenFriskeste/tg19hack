We noticed a few suspicious owls trying to deliver letters with
mysterious ASCII text, but we have no clue what it is...

We managed to intercept one [mystery message](uploads/intercepted_message.txt) before it was delivered. 
After tracking down the source sending the owls, we found out that it is sending different ASCII text
every time!

Can you please check it out, and help digging us out of 
this hole? You can find the mysterious source at:

This is not a typical crypto challenge, but rather finding hidden data somewhere.
The owls have nothing to do with the challenge, but are here to make things more magical.
