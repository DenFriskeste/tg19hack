				<td>The wandmaker Gregorovitch wrote that hawthorn ‘makes a strange, contradictory wand, as full of
					paradoxes as the tree that gave it birth, whose leaves and blossoms heal, and yet whose cut branches
					smell of death.’ While I disagree with many of Gregorovitch’s conclusions, we concur about hawthorn
					wands, which are complex and intriguing in their natures, just like the owners who best suit them.
					Hawthorn wands may be particularly suited to healing magic, but they are also adept at curses, and I
					have generally observed that the hawthorn wand seems most at home with a conflicted nature, or with
					a witch or wizard passing through a period of turmoil. Hawthorn is not easy to master, however, and
					I would only ever consider placing a hawthorn wand in the hands of a witch or wizard of proven
					talent, or the consequences might be dangerous. Hawthorn wands have a notable peculiarity: their
					spells can, when badly handled, backfire.</td>
