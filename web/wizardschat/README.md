Owls and crystal balls are becoming increasingly outdated for communication
in the wizarding world. Instant messaging of the sort muggles have had for
a long time is starting to establish itself in the wizarding world.

A new chat service for wizards, with integrated muggle protection, has recently
come online. Since technology is still foreign to wizards there may be security
issues, can you find any?
